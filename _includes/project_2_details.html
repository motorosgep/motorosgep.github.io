                <hr class="star-primary">

                <p>During my time at Wavy, we had one developer per platform on the frontend side. I was the one developing the Android app and had to work
                  closely with the designer, project manager, tester and the other devs. The project was a good mixture of hardcore technical and interesting UI/UX stuff.</p>

                  <h4>Security</h4>
                  <p>Since we were "dealing with actual money" security was key. During this time I have learned a lot about forced updates, detecting rooted devices, encryption, certificate pinning, SMS codes and challenge-response authentication.</p>

                  <h4>User-centric</h4>
                  <p>We integrated with lots of 3rd party SDKs for various features, like "Login with Facebook" made it possible to streamline the sign-up process, Firebase for remote configuration based A/B testing, InstaBug for beta feedback, had Intercom for better communication with the users and used the Jumio's Netverify for KYC.</p>

                  <h4>Emotional design</h4>
                  <p>We did rapid design iterations and they had one thing in common, they were unique. It wasn't the usual (and sadly widespread) approach of designing for iOS and porting it Android and neither was using Material Design.</p>
                  <p>This meant dozens of custom UI elements and animations. It was challenging, but fun. Learned a lot about SVG animations, drawing on canvas and animating it. I'm proud of the "wave" which is a custom view drawing this shape and animating it.</p>
