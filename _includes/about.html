                    <p>I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).

                    <p>I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.</p>
